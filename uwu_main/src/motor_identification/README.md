# Motor identification
A helper package to help to identify which motors map to which ID in the `Motors` msg.

To run,

```sh
ros2 run motor_identification run_motor_solo
```

This package requires the node `/keypress` to be running first. Check the `teleop` package to find this node.

To see the controls, press `h` while the node is running for help.
